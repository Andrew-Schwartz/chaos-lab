# Onset of Chaos

Code to generate bifurcation plots for my Computer Based Experiments class. Mathematica had problems generating graphs 
with as much precision as I wanted, so I wrote some Rust to make some very large plots with a lot of points.

Two such graphs are shown inline below.

[Large Onset of Chaos Graph](chaos.png) (`25,600×19,200`)

Also included are [Small Onset of Chaos Graph](chaos_small.png) (`5,120×3,840`), which is a small enough file to be 
shown in my lab report pdf without lag, and [Very Large Onset of Chaos Graph](chaos_very_large.png) (`40,960×30,720`), 
which is just really big (too big to even be shown in `GitHub`, to view this picture please download it).
